# NativeApps2-iOS

My iOS application for "Native Apps: 2" is in this repository.

It's an app about the different locations of loadpoints in Gent.

Functionalities: 
- Check what is the closest loadpoint to your location
- Get a list of all the loadpoints and search in that list with a category and a text filter
- Get a mapkit card of all the loadpoints who are close to the user

This application is made in Xcode Swift.
